Divinity International Traders - Website files (No Logo)

Files included:
- index.html  (main site) - header shows text brand instead of logo
- placeholder_kulhad_*.jpg  (product images placeholders)
- placeholder_k1..k5.jpg (gallery placeholders)

Instructions:
1) Open index.html in browser to preview.
2) Replace placeholder images with your real images or edit content as needed.
3) To host: upload all files to GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages, or deploy to Netlify/Vercel.

If you later want me to add your uploaded logo file into the site, say "add logo" and upload the file.
